## Acknowledgments

Thanks to the JAX team for providing such an incredible tool for
numerical computation in Python.  To the cosmology and astronomy
community for the valuable datasets and research that inform this
package. We are especially grateful to the contributors to the Core
Cosmology Library [CCL](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCL) against which
the accuracy of this code has been tested,
[astropy.cosmology](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/cosmology/index.html)
for its clean and inspiring interface and of course
[jax-cosmo](https://github.com/DifferentiableUniverseInitiative/jax_cosmo),
pioneer and much more advanced in differentiable cosmology
computations.
